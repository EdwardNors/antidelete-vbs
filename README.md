# antidelete-vbs
This code example in VBScript creates a plain text file on the C:\ drive and sets system attributes that prevent the file from being deleted, renamed or altered. Additionally, the script disallows access to the file for all users and locks it to prevent write access by other processes.

The file can only be opened by a program that executes from an administrator account, which helps to prevent accidental deletion. The script also displays a message indicating that the file has been successfully protected.

This code example has to do with information security and can be used to restrict access to sensitive data by other users.
